### What it is
S-ART is a student CubeSat mission concept built to combine a real science target with strong engineering practice.

### Goals
- Deliver a clean, testable subsystem architecture.
- Keep documentation and tools as first-class outputs.
- Build an analysis pipeline (power, data, comms budgets, etc.).

### Notes
This page will evolve into a mission brief with subsystem pages, figures, and results.
